### You can become an admin on your Stormwork server as follows:

In the web interface of your game server, click on "Configs" under settings on the left:

Now you see the "Stormworks server_config.xml". Click on the blue pencil to edit:

Afterwards you can add a Steam64ID in the section "admin", which should get admin rights:

If you want to add more admins, enter them below each other:

After you have entered the admins, you can save the config on the "Save" button:

Now restart your server and all registered Steam64IDs have admin rights.
